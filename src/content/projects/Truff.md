Truff was my business that I had with my partner, but due to a lack of time, we no longer dedicate energy to it. It was a website aimed at gathering all adoption listings for dogs, cats, NAC and other pets. Our goal was for this site to be used by shelters and the SPCA to give abandoned animals more visibility and promote them for a second chance at a fulfilled and happy life. The site was also open to individuals who, unfortunately, wanted to part with their pets, to more seriously oversee adoptions because it's not a decision to be taken lightly ! The design i am sharing with you is a snippet of what the Truff app would have looked like on mobile. There are a few small issues, of which i am aware.
