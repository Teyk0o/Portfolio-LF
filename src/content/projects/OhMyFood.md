The "OhMyFood" website is a project I had to create for the OpenClassRooms school as part of the Web Integrator course. OhMyFood aims to facilitate the ordering process for restaurants, allowing customers to select their starter, main course, and dessert before arriving at the restaurant. When they arrive, everything is ready, eliminating waiting times. I built this website entirely by hand, using HTML and SASS, incorporating animations such as a Like animation, a selector animation, and finally a loader. You can see all the different animations present on the site in the image.
