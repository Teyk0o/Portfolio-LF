The drawing named "Disney & Pixar" is a mix of drawings inspired by Pinterest. It was created on December 23, 2023. Each character took me 30 to 40 minutes to draw, so 2 or 3 in total. Initially, I sketched the drawing with a pencil and then colored it using alcohol-based markers. This drawing marks my first time using these markers.
